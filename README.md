# Introduction
Noodle Docs is a Google Docs clone made completely in ReactJS along with some other support libraries. It offers the basic functions of a word processor to manipulate text. This project was done to explore the document contentEditable feature of HTML elements along with building user interfaces in ReactJS.

# How It Works
The document contentEditable function of HTML elements allows users to type inside of HTML elements. It's API also comes with various text manipulating functions such as the ability to change font size, colors, make lists, etc.  You can find a full list of commands here: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/execCommand]

The user selects some text inside of the contentEditable element, and calls different functions depending on which was clicked.

# Technologies Used
For building the user interface and various interactions, **ReactJS** was used. This JavaScript library was used to build the entire app along with the help of create-react-app to bootstrap the application.

Styling of the React components was done using the styling library **styled-components** along with some inline styling. You can learn more about styling React components via my article where I describe the various methods that are used:
